# ⭐ Recommended Installation Method

## Use `Install Helper.bat`

The archive includes:

```text
Install Helper.bat
```

This helper can:

* Automatically detect:

  * Your GTA V edition
  * Your Script Hook V .NET version
* Tell you exactly which folder to install
* Provide a manual selection mode if automatic detection fails

### Automatic Detection Checks

The helper detects:

## GTA V Version

Using `GTA5.exe` file version:

* `1.0.3.x` → GTA V Legacy
* `1.0.1.x` → GTA V Enhanced

## Script Hook V .NET Version

Using `ScriptHookVDotNet3.dll` file version:

* `3.7.0.x` → Script Hook V .NET (nightly)
* `3.9.0.x` → Script Hook V .NET Enhanced (SHVDNE)

4. Extract these files into your GTA V directory
   (where `GTA5.exe` is located):

```text

> Ignore the "for developers" files unless you specifically need them.

# ⚠️ Important Notes

* The correct build depends on BOTH:

  * Your GTA V edition
  * Your Script Hook V .NET version

* GTA V Legacy users can use:

  * Script Hook V .NET (nightly)
  * OR SHVDNE

* GTA V Enhanced users must use:

  * SHVDNE only

* Installing the wrong build may cause:

  * The script not loading
  * Runtime errors
  * Missing menu behavior
  * Script incompatibility

* If automatic detection fails, use Manual Installation mode.

* If `ScriptHookVDotNet3.dll` is missing:

  * Script Hook V .NET is not installed yet
  * OR installed incorrectly

* Compatibility may change depending on future GTA V updates or Script Hook V .NET updates.
